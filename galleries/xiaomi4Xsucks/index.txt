I bought a brand new Xiaomi Redmi 4X off Lazada and the different apps keep crashing during the initial setup process.
I will never, ever buy a Xiaomi smartphone or tablet again. The hardware specs are great, but I cannot tolerate a product that crashes within the first 5 minutes of turning it on for the first time.
