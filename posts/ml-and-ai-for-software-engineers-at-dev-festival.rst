Yesterday morning at Microsoft Philippines, I gave a short talk introducing AI and machine learning to software engineers.
Instead of walking through my usual R or Python code, I did a demo using Microsoft's own ML Studio, which was helpful for visualizing the machine learning process.

Most of the Q&A was about the possible impact of AI on jobs, inequality and security/privacy.
