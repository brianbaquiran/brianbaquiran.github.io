For developers unable to make it to the annual Google I/O conference, Google holds I/O Extended events in cities around the world. This year Google Developer Group Philippines went all out and held I/O Extended events in five major cities, demonstrating their new APIs and services available to developers.

For the Manila leg, I ran a workshop for Google Cloud Platform's Natural Language API, for an audience of mostly students. In retrospect, NLP is too advanced and specialized field for undergrads or novice developers, unless they have a specific application or are using NLP already.

A number of the students couldn't get past signing up with GCP, which requires a credit card. 

In the future, I'll need to be more upfront with the prerequisites and level of experience needed to get the most out of  my workshops.
